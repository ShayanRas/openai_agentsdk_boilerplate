# Multi-Agent Handoffs - Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## Handoff Mechanism Deep Dive

### Core Concept
Handoffs are a specialized tool call type that enables one agent to transfer control to another agent. This is fundamentally different from simple tool calling - it's a control flow mechanism for agent orchestration.

### Handoff Architecture

#### 1. Handoff Definition
```python
# Agent with handoff capabilities
primary_agent = Agent(
    name="Primary",
    instructions="You are a primary agent that can delegate tasks",
    handoffs=[specialist_agent_1, specialist_agent_2]  # Available handoff targets
)
```

#### 2. Handoff Trigger Patterns
- **Explicit Request**: User asks for specialized functionality
- **Capability Gap**: Current agent lacks required expertise
- **Task Complexity**: Breaking down complex tasks
- **Context Switch**: Moving between different domains

### Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Sequential Handoffs
```python
# Router → Specialist → Validator
router_agent = Agent(
    name="Router",
    instructions="Analyze requests and route to appropriate specialist",
    handoffs=[specialist_agent, validator_agent]
)

specialist_agent = Agent(
    name="Specialist",
    instructions="Handle specialized tasks and pass to validator",
    handoffs=[validator_agent]
)

validator_agent = Agent(
    name="Validator", 
    instructions="Validate and finalize results"
)
```

#### Pattern 2: Conditional Routing
```python
# Dynamic agent selection based on context
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="Orchestrator",
    instructions="""
    Route tasks based on type:
    - Technical questions → Technical Specialist
    - Creative tasks → Creative Specialist  
    - Analysis tasks → Data Analyst
    """,
    handoffs=[tech_specialist, creative_specialist, data_analyst]
)
```

#### Pattern 3: Hierarchical Delegation
```python
# Manager coordinating multiple specialists
manager_agent = Agent(
    name="Manager",
    instructions="Coordinate complex multi-step projects",
    handoffs=[research_agent, writing_agent, review_agent]
)

# Specialists with cross-handoff capabilities
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher", 
    instructions="Research topics and hand off to writer",
    handoffs=[writing_agent]
)

writing_agent = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="Create content and hand off for review", 
    handoffs=[review_agent]
)
```

#### Pattern 4: Parallel Processing Coordination
```python
# Coordinator managing parallel work
coordinator = Agent(
    name="Coordinator",
    instructions="Manage parallel processing and consolidate results",
    handoffs=[worker_1, worker_2, worker_3, consolidator]
)

consolidator = Agent(
    name="Consolidator",
    instructions="Merge results from parallel workers"
)
```

### Advanced Handoff Techniques

#### Context Preservation Across Handoffs
```python
class ProjectContext(BaseModel):
    project_id: str
    current_phase: str
    requirements: List[str]
    results: Dict[str, Any]

# Context preserved through handoff chain
result = Runner.run(
    orchestrator_agent,
    user_input,
    context=ProjectContext(
        project_id="proj_123",
        current_phase="analysis",
        requirements=["requirement1", "requirement2"],
        results={}
    )
)
```

#### Handoff with State Management
```python
# Agent tracks handoff state
class HandoffState(BaseModel):
    current_agent: str
    handoff_history: List[str]
    pending_tasks: List[str]
    completed_tasks: List[str]

# State-aware handoff logic
state_manager = Agent(
    name="StateManager",
    instructions="Track project state and manage handoffs based on completion",
    handoffs=[agent_a, agent_b, agent_c]
)
```

### Handoff Best Practices

#### 1. Clear Handoff Instructions
```python
agent = Agent(
    name="RouterAgent",
    instructions="""
    You are a router agent. Use handoffs when:
    - User asks for code review → Hand off to CodeReviewer
    - User asks for documentation → Hand off to DocWriter  
    - User asks for testing → Hand off to TestEngineer
    
    Always explain why you're handing off and what the specialist will do.
    """
)
```

#### 2. Handoff Validation
```python
# Validate handoff targets
def validate_handoff_target(target_agent, task_type):
    if task_type == "code_review" and target_agent.name != "CodeReviewer":
        raise ValueError("Invalid handoff target for code review")
    return True
```

#### 3. Error Recovery in Handoffs
```python
fallback_agent = Agent(
    name="Fallback",
    instructions="Handle tasks when specialists are unavailable"
)

primary_agent = Agent(
    name="Primary",
    instructions="Try specialist first, fallback if needed",
    handoffs=[specialist_agent, fallback_agent]
)
```

### Multi-Agent Communication Patterns

#### 1. Information Passing
- Context objects carry information between agents
- Structured data models ensure consistency
- State persistence across handoffs

#### 2. Result Aggregation
```python
# Results from multiple agents
aggregator = Agent(
    name="Aggregator",
    instructions="Collect and synthesize results from multiple specialists",
    handoffs=[]  # Terminal agent
)
```

#### 3. Feedback Loops
```python
# Agent can hand back to previous agent for refinement
reviewer = Agent(
    name="Reviewer",
    instructions="Review work and send back for improvements if needed",
    handoffs=[original_agent, final_approver]
)
```

### Workflow Orchestration

#### Runner Patterns for Multi-Agent
```python
# Sequential execution with handoffs
async def multi_agent_workflow(user_input, context):
    # Start with orchestrator
    result = await Runner.run(
        orchestrator_agent,
        user_input, 
        context=context
    )
    
    # Track handoff chain
    handoff_history = []
    current_result = result
    
    while current_result.has_handoff:
        target_agent = current_result.handoff_target
        handoff_history.append(target_agent.name)
        
        current_result = await Runner.run(
            target_agent,
            current_result.handoff_message,
            context=current_result.context
        )
    
    return current_result, handoff_history
```

### Performance Considerations

#### 1. Handoff Overhead
- Each handoff involves model calls
- Context transfer costs
- State management complexity

#### 2. Optimization Strategies
- Cache agent responses when possible
- Minimize context size in handoffs
- Use streaming for long-running workflows
- Implement handoff timeouts

#### 3. Monitoring and Debugging
- Track handoff chains
- Monitor agent performance
- Implement handoff logging
- Use tracing for workflow visualization

This handoff system enables sophisticated agent orchestration while maintaining clear separation of concerns and specialized capabilities.
